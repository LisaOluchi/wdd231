        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hi my name is Lisa. The proud owner of Lich3D Studio's, I am a digital creative and 3D designer specializing in custom designs, 3D printing, and bringing concepts to life in the digital and tech world. With a background in Applied Technology and Computer Science, I blend technical precision with artistic vision to produce unique digital art, fashion pieces, and interactive 3D models. 

        My work is rooted in the belief that creativity can elevate the everyday experience, whether it's through crafting personalized fashion pieces, designing furniture, or developing digital assets for gaming and animation. I am also passionate about the evolving world of digital fashion and am exploring the intersection of technology and self-expression through Lich3D Studios. 
        
        Beyond design, my journey includes studies in cybersecurity, programming, and web development, equipping me with a versatile skill set that supports my work. I'm committed to creating accessible and inspiring tools that make self-expression through style easy and enjoyable for everyone. Welcome to my world, where every project is an opportunity to merge innovation and artistry!
